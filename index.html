This is a walkthrough of the process I went through to develop Caladan.

First of all, I wasn't paid to develop such software, nor is programming part of my job. I developed Caladan in my free time to make my job easier and to help me learn software engineering through side projects.

Data visualization through plots and charts is important for analysis and analytics in engineering and business but it is sometimes overlooked. In my job I encounter a lot of cases where I need to plot data for the client to follow pressure and temperature changes during different operationsi <em>on site</em>. And for that we need a tool that makes it easy to load different sensors data, plot it, interact with it and possibly export it under a different format that the client wants.

Drawing plots is one of the simplest things to do on computers today. Excel which is a very popular software can draw plots.
